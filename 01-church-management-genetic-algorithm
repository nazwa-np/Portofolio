## Church Management System â€“ Genetic Algorithm Optimization

ðŸ“„ **Description**  
This project focuses on optimizing church event and resource management using a Genetic Algorithm.  
Built with Laravel, it automates scheduling for worship services, volunteers, and facilities to minimize time conflicts and maximize efficiency.

---

ðŸ§° **Tools & Skills**  
**Tools:** Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Visual Studio Code  
**Skills:** Full Stack Web Development, Algorithm Implementation, Database Design, Optimization Techniques
