## API Validation 

ðŸ“„ **Description**  
**API Validation System** is a **JavaScript-based** designed to validate, test, and monitor RESTful APIs efficiently.  
The system ensures that API endpoints return accurate and secure responses by validating request parameters, response formats, and authentication headers.  
It helps developers maintain high-quality APIs through automated validation and real-time error detection.

ðŸ§° **Tools & Skills**  
**Tools:** JavaScript (Node.js), Express.js, Postman, JSON Schema, Visual Studio Code  
**Skills:** API Development, Data Validation, Error Handling, Backend Logic, RESTful Architecture, Testing Automation

ðŸ§ª **Scenario**  
In many web applications, developers often face issues with inconsistent API responses, missing parameters, or unvalidated data that can lead to system errors and security vulnerabilities.  
The **API Validation System** addresses these challenges by implementing robust validation logic that checks every incoming request and response.  
It automatically detects errors such as invalid JSON structure, incorrect data types, and unauthorized access, ensuring reliability and consistency across all API endpoints.

âœ… **Outcome & Benefits**

- Ensures data integrity through strict input and output validation  
- Reduces debugging time by detecting API errors early  
- Enhances application security through token and schema validation  
- Provides a standardized and reusable validation layer for scalable API projects  
- Demonstrates practical use of **JavaScript and Express.js** in backend system development
