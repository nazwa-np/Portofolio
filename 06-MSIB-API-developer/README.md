## MSIB API Integration System

ðŸ“„ **Description**  
**MSIB API Integration System** is a **JavaScript (Node.js)-based web service** developed as part of the **Kampus Merdeka Program** by the **Indonesian Ministry of Education (Kemendikbud)**.  
This project focuses on integrating **RESTful APIs** with a **mobile application**, enabling seamless data communication between backend services and client-side interfaces.  
The system ensures efficient data synchronization, authentication, and response validation to support real-time access for **MSIB participants and administrators**.
