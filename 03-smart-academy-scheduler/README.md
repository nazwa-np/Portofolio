## Smart Academy Scheduler

ðŸ“„ **Description**  
**Smart Academy Scheduler** is a **Laravel-based web application** designed to automate and optimize academic schedule generation in a university department using the **Genetic Algorithm**.  
The system helps administrators efficiently assign courses, lecturers, and classrooms by considering constraints such as lecturer availability, course load, and room capacity â€” resulting in an optimal and conflict-free timetable.

ðŸ§ª **Scenario**  
In many universities, academic scheduling is still performed manually, often leading to class conflicts, inefficient room usage, and high administrative workload.  
**Smart Academy Scheduler** solves these issues by applying a **Genetic Algorithm** to automatically generate the best and conflict-free schedule.  
The system evaluates multiple scheduling possibilities and selects the most optimal one based on parameters such as lecturer workload balance and time slot efficiency.
